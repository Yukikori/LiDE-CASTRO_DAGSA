## Chronicle of Mobile Gaming

This is a project proposal for Computer Science 3, and will discuss in a choose-your-own-path format how mobile games have evolved, from Angry Birds to Genshin Impact. Each page will discuss a game that has defined the way we see mobile gaming, including its backstories and graphics.

This website will comprise of the following webpages:

1. Homepage - This will serve as a landing page for the people who are curious enough to visit it. It will give a summary of how mobile gaming has evolved over the years.
2. Angry Birds (beginnings of mobile gaming)
3. Bejeweled (classic genres of mobile games)
4. Call of Duty: Mobile (newer genres i.e. first-person shooters)
5. Genshin Impact (mobile gaming as it stands)
