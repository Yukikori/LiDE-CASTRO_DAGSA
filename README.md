## Evolution of Mobile Gaming

This is a project proposal for Computer Science 3, and will discuss in a computer-in-a-browser format how mobile games have evolved, from Angry Birds to Genshin Impact. Each page will discuss a game that has changed the way we see mobile gaming, including the backstory and graphics.

This website will comprise of the following webpages:

1. Homepage - This will serve as a landing page for the people who are curious enough to visit it. It will give a summary of how mobile gaming has evolved over the years.
2. Angry Birds (beginnings of mobile gaming)
3. Genshin Impact (mobile gaming as it stands)

`We hope this will be a fun experience, both to improve web development skills and collaboration with classmates.`
