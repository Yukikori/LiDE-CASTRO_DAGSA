    <h3>Open-World Action RPG</h3>
    <p>An RPG (Roleplaying Game) is a type of game where you, the player, goes through a story set by either the developers or the players themselves.</p>
    <p>An example of this type of game is "Genshin Impact", a game where you play as a traveller looking for their sibling in a new world. At the beginning of the game, the twins get separated via a fight with a god. The twin that you choose to play as will be your character until the end of the game. During the game, you will meet multiple different characters with different personalities and backstories, while you go through the game's quests by going to each nation of the game's world.</p>
    <p>Genshin Impact has an element system, where each element has specific reactions that you can interact with them. Multiple different enemies will also fight you, and by defeating them you get materials, exp, and lots of other things important for your journey. Enemies have different gimmicks and things that they can do so be careful! Stronger enemies will give more rewards, an example of such enemy are the bosses and the domain bosses. The difference between bosses and domain bosses are; you need materials dropped by bosses to "ascend" your characters and level them up further, while domain bosses will only drop rewards one time a week but these rewards are better, these bosses are also called "Weekly Bosses"</p>
