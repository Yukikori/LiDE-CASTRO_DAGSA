                <p class="text-lg">
                    Angry Birds is a casual video game wherein the player must launch birds from a slingshot in
                    order to defeat green pigs stationed in or around structures. Birds can have special abilities, 
                    such as Bomb, who can explode upon landing, and Chuck, who can dash forward.<br><br>

                    This game is one of many classic games that were played by many mobile gamers around the world. Young 
                    children loved the game and, as a consequence, its popularity rised dramatically, that it helped 
                    create the Angry Birds movie series, which were also equally popular with moviegoers.<br><br>

                    This defined an era in mobile gaming, and it remains a beloved nostalgia-inducer for people who 
                    come back to it or continue to play it to this day.
